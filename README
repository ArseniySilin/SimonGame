Simon is a game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison with 
software programming by Lenny Cope. 

The original device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat 
the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more 
complex.

Once the user fails in a strict mode, the game is over. If user is not in a strict mode 
the sequence repeats. 

You can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct.
